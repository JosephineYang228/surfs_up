### Three key differences
- The number of valid counting days of December is much more than that in June.
- The standard deviation of December is larger than June, which means the weather is more changeable in December.
- The lowest temperature of December is significantly lower which demonstrates June may be a better month for surffing.
## Summary
As for me, surf and ice cream shop business is NOT sustainable year-round, cause for the temperature in winter is not that comfortable for surfing and eating ice-cream. However, operating surf and ice-cream shop business would be a great decision in Hawaii summer.
